              As a Full-Stack Developer for the Muslim Student Association at
              Memorial University of Newfoundland, I developed and maintained a
              NextJS app using JavaScript and TypeScript within an Agile team. I
              employed the Bootstrap framework for front-end styling and used
              React components for modular, dynamic user interfaces. The app
              featured secure OAuth user authentication with ExpressJS and was
              hosted on AWS Amplify with a CI/CD pipeline for streamlined
              deployment. I also created comprehensive codebase documentation to
              facilitate onboarding for new developers.
