              As a Full-Stack Developer for the Muslim Student Association at
              Memorial University of Newfoundland, I developed and maintained a
              NextJS app using JavaScript and TypeScript within an Agile team. I
              employed the Bootstrap framework for front-end styling and used
              React components for modular, dynamic user interfaces. The app
              featured secure JWT and OAuth user authentication using the MERN
              stack and was hosted on AWS Amplify with a CI/CD pipeline for
              streamlined deployment. I also created comprehensive codebase
              documentation to facilitate onboarding for new developers.
